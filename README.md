# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Important

Be sure to utilize the [MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide](../Supplemental/MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf) in order to deploy your assignment.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](burger_demo.mp4).
