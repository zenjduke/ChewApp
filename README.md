# Chew

### A journal for culinary connoisseurs.

Chew is a full stack application built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars and W3CSS to generate and style the HTML.

## Description

The user logs restaurant experiences by adding each to the MySQL database and can toggle them by clicking on each, moving it into the adjacent table and updating its status in the database.

### Demo

The demo of Chew can be found [here](https://pure-plateau-44498.herokuapp.com/).
